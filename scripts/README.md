# scripts

**hdelete**: A simple script I use to find certain hidden files that are generated by operating systems when I'm
transferring files from one to the other or preparing to make a zip/container archive. It will run in the current 
directory of the terminal window or you can run on a specific directory using the `--d` flag.

**imagepush**: Mainly an overly complicated exercise - but one that does currently work. This script will tag a docker
image for AWS ECR and push to your ECR repository. Upon running; the script will ask for three inputs: the AWS account 
number, the image/repository name, and the tag. Take note that at my current position we use MFA and role assumption for 
our AWS work - so you may need to edit the `session` variable to suit your login needs if you use this. Or you can do 
the same actions as this script via three lines in the terminal. ;-)
