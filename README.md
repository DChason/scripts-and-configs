**scripts-and-configs** is where I stash all my personal scripts, system tweaks, and app configs. These are items that "works on my machine" filled with hardcoded values, magic numbers, and brittle execution - duct tape without polish. There are no install guides, no support, and no warranty. If you find something useful, awesome - take it and make it yours - but you're probably going to have to tweak...a bit.

Caveat Emptor.
