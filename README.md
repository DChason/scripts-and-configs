# Scripts and Configs
Small scripts and configurations. Assorted with no rhyme or reason.

These are used mainly for setting up my own systems until I get around to creating a more automated process or for general tasks that I may perform once in blue moon and will end up forgetting.

On the off chance you find something useful for yourself; use as desired.
