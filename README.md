scripts-and-configs

my digital junk drawer.

this repository is where i stash all my personal scripts, system tweaks, and app configs. these are items that "work for my specific use case" filled with hardcoded values, magic strings/numbers, and brittle execution. expect duct tape, not polish - caveat emptor.

here there are no real install guides, no support, and no warranty. if you find something useful, awesome - take it and make it yours - but you're probably going to have to tweak a bit.

what's inside
scripts/
quick-and-dirty scripts that are organized by language. expect random tinkerings, one-off fixes, and code that's more "get it done" than "do it right".

system/
the catch-all for everything that can be related to the operating system and installed applications.

os-specific
linux and macos for settings, tweaks, and dotfiles unique to each operating system.

configs
application and tool configurations - sometimes split by os if setups diverge.

install
application and tool installations.
